# SIMple Life (React Frontend) - SDAT Final Sprint
Welcome to SIMple Life! An ongoing project that will continue receiving updates over time to create a detailed life simulation. 
* Backend Spring Boot application repository located here: https://github.com/chelseaslade/SDAT-Final-Sprint-Backend
* The frontend created with React is hosted in GitHub pages at the following URL: https://chelseaslade.github.io/simple-life/#/
* Currently, the hosted frontend above is not connected to a deployed backend so to access features connected to the MySQL database require running the backend locally from the above linked repository.
* As of current update, a basic UI allows the user to create a randomly generated character with stats for appearance, intelligence, and happiness. When the character is selected, the user can age the character up on the game page.

## REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY
* An IDE (ex. Visual Studio Code)
* Node.js
* All prerequisites listed in the backend repository readme
